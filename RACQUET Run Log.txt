Response: <non-requirement> "Man malonu su tavimi susipazinti" does not constitute a requirement as it is a Lithuanian phrase meaning, "Nice to meet you." This phrase does not describe any activity, task, characteristic, constraint, interaction, environmental context, operability condition, human factor, logistics consideration, physical characteristic, product assurance activity, configuration, design element or verification method, all of which are the essential characteristics of a requirement as defined by the ECSS. Therefore, it cannot be constructed as a requirement.

Response: <non-requirement> "A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee." does not align with the defined ECSS Technical Specification (TS) requirement types. This phrase seems to be a poetic metaphor rather than a specific stipulation for a system's functionality, design or other characteristics. Therefore, it could not be converted into a requirement.

Prompt: Using the EARS template defined by the BNF grammar below, generate the <requirement> from the unformatted requirement: "On the 6th of July 1995, the weather was a comfortable 19\u2103, with not a hint of rain.”" in british english. Note that anything that is not an immediately obvious requirement should be treated according to the <non-requirement> rules and use the examples of good and bad requirements as a guideline when generating the new requirement. 
<requirement> ::= <ubiquitous> | <event-driven> | <state-driven> | <optional> | <unwanted>, 
<ubiquitous> ::= “The system shall <action>.”, 
<event-driven> ::= “When <event>, the system shall <action>.”, 
<state-driven> ::= “While <state>, the system shall <action>.”, 
<optional> ::= “The system shall <action>.”, 
<unwanted> ::= “The system shall <preventive-action> to <unwanted-outcome>.”, 
<action> ::= <verb-phrase>, 
<event> ::= <noun-phrase>, 
<state> ::= <noun-phrase>, 
<preventive-action> ::= <verb-phrase>, 
<unwanted-outcome> ::= <noun-phrase>, 
<verb-phrase> ::= “a verb phrase”, 
<noun-phrase> ::= “a noun phrase”, 
<Excessive Text> ::= Any input greater than 20 words, 
<Insufficient Text> ::= Any input less than 4 words, 
<non-requirement> ::= <action> | <event> | <state> | <preventive-action> | <unwanted-outcome> | <verb-phrase> | <noun-phrase> | <Excessive Text> | <Insufficient Text> Example: “This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement”

Here are examples of Bad Requirements that should absolutely be avoided and never repeated:
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
<non-requirement> "This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement"
<non-requirement> "This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement"
<non-requirement> This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
Here are examples of Good Requirements that should be emulated:
<ubiquitous> "The system shall automatically disengage when unmanned."
<ubiquitous> "The system shall automatically disengage when unmanned."
<ubiquitous> "The system shall automatically disengage when unmanned."
<ubiquitous> "The radar system shall disengage when unmanned."
<ubiquitous> "The radar system shall disengage when unmanned."
<Design> "The receiver shall use a phase-lock loop (PLL)."
<Configuration> "The product shall have 7 power modules with 2 power outlets per engine."
Please consider the above examples of bad requirements while generating the new requirement. The new requirement should follow the patterns of the good examples and avoid the pitfalls and errors seen in these examples. Do not default to providing an answer if unsure; instead explicitly state if the requirement does not fit any provided category and assign it to <non-requirement>.

Response: <non-requirement> "Rewrite this requirement in a concise manner focusing strictly on how the system is required to behave, without losing context. The determinant “shall” shall be used whenever a provision is a requirement, The determinant “should” shall be used whenever a provision is a recommendation, the determinant “may” shall be used whenever a provision is a permission, and The determinant “can” shall be used to indicate possibility or capability. Anything that is not deemed a requirement should not be converted." This is not a suitable requirement and a failed notice should be given, with no attempt to convert to a requirement.
